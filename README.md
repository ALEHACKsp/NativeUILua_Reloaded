## - Warning, NativeUI-Shared.lua will not be kept update, I invite the community to update it with the changes. 

### - ‚ö†Ô∏è Following a change and for more understanding I decided to remove the fork and to dedicate a repository to this magnificent project that will be named NativeUI Reloaded , previously based on [FrazzIe](https://github.com/FrazzIe) work.
