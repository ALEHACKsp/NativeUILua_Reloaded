## üìä Resource resmon 1 

- I have noticed a lot of negative opinions about the consumption of NativeUILua, that's why I decided to make a comparison of the consumption of the most popular menu creation resources. 
   - NativeUI (https://github.com/citizenfx/NativeUI) C#
   - MenuAPI (https://github.com/TomGrobbe/MenuAPI) C#
   - NativeUILua-Reloaded (https://github.com/iTexZoz/NativeUILua-Reloaded) Lua
